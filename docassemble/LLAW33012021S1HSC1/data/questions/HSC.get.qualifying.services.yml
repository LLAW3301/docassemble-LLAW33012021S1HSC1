# Goes through the list that corresponds to the selected council and
# extracts all the qualifying services. Puts those services in a list
# that maps to their specific category.
# These lists are what will be displayed in the display_output file
#
# Testing rationale:
#  A service should be added to the list of qualifying services:
#    - If the input age falls between it's min and max ages
#    - If it caters toward the specified gender
#    - If it caters toward the specified family situation
#    - If it does not exclusively cater toward atsi and the user does not identify as atsi, or, since no service should exclude atsi, if the user does identify as atsi
#    - If it caters toward the at least one of the selected concessions and other factors. If no concessions or other factors are selected, then the as a default it will still be added unless it is specifically categorised as a 'Relevant' service
